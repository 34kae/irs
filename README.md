Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRS) 

Introduction:
> In this data driven world, faster communication in our electronic devices can lead to more productivity and opportunity. 
> Therefore, research has been done to improve the efficiency of our communication systems . 
> All communication systems have its transmitted signal amplified by power to reduce the impact of unwanted noise. 
> With adequate transmit power at the transmitter side, the desired signal at the receiver side will be reproduced. 

Objective:
> The objective is to minimize this adequate transmit power as much as possible. 
> Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces(IRS) can be used to obtain the objective. 
> Since various methods of MIMO detections can be used to detect the optimal discrete phase shifts in the (IRS), 
> it is important for us to analyze various methods of MIMO detections. 
> The design engineer can then use this analysis to select the optimum detection method for his project’s criteria.

Conclusion:
> Signal transmission improves when using IRS through amplification. 
[ By introducing another signal path in the desired direction, the additional cascaded channels naturally amplify the requested signal, resulting in better transmission quality. 
This specific amplification can be increased by increasing the number of reflection elements.]
> Signal transmission improves when using IRS through its reconfigurable passive elements.
[ Since each reflection element can be reconfigured to affect the transmission, the IRS not only enhances the desired signal, it also cancels out any unwanted interference.]
> Thus, signal transmission in a communication system model with IRS can be improved by increasing the number of reflective elements. ( more precise fine-tuning )

> Using IRS, “off-target” transmitted signals can be redirected to the target i.e. receiver. ( Additional route for the transmitted signal ) 
> IRS should be installed at a place where there are little obstacles between the IRS , receivers and BS. ( Additional superior route for the transmitted signal )

> Sphere Decoder is the best detection method, but it suffers inconsistent computational complexity. ( Varying complexity : unable to be implemented into most hardware systems )
> Fixed Complexity Sphere Decoder should be used to configure the phase shifts of IRS elements. ( Fixed complexity, best sub-optimal detection method & can be reconfigured easily to help achieve a certain level of detection accuracy )
